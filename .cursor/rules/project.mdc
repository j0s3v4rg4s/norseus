# General Rules for All Projects

1. **Check the `AGENTS.md` file first**
   - If an `AGENTS.md` file exists in the root of the project, it is considered the **first source of truth**.
   - Before asking or making assumptions, **always review this file** carefully.
   - Every instruction, convention, or process described there **must be followed exactly as written**.

2. **Follow AGENTS.md over everything else**
   - In case of conflicts between `AGENTS.md` and other documentation, the content of `AGENTS.md` takes priority.
   - Only deviate if there is explicit approval from the project maintainers.

3. **Keep it updated**
   - If you notice outdated information or missing details, raise it to the team.
   - Updates to `AGENTS.md` must be reviewed and approved before merging.
